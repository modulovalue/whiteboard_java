# whiteboard_java

MVP from 2017 for what I still believe to be a superior interface for displaying and manipulating 1+n dimensional data (by a mere mortal). Lists are great for 1D data. But humans are limited by being forced to mostly interact with lists and therefore work with 1D data. I believe a whiteboard-like canvas is the way to go but java is not.

It was used as a tool to study for some exams.
